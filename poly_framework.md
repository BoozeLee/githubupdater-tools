# Deployable Polymorphic Linux/AI Framework for Adaptive GitHub Workflow Automation

This document details a modern, modular, and mathematically robust framework for **self-adaptive, AI-enhanced GitHub workflow automation** on Linux, fully deployable and validated by the latest research, industry best practices, and polymorphic code theory.

## 1. Theoretical Foundations

- **Linear Algebra & Matrix Operations:** Used for tool ranking, deep learning, and workflow graph computations.
- **Graph Theory:** Models workflow dependencies, automates branching, and optimizes job sequencing.
- **Probability & Statistics:** Powers adaptive ranking/scoring of automation tools and predicts workflow success.
- **Optimization Theory:** Finds the fastest and most reliable paths/configurations for CI/CD and automation tasks.
- **Information Theory (Entropy):** Quantifies adaptability/diversity of workflows and automation decisions.

## 2. Polymorphic Modular Framework (Python, Linux, GitHub)

The core engine leverages live tool discovery, adaptive scoring, and plug-and-play workflow generation.

### Core Components

1. **Tool Discovery**: Automatically finds top GitHub automation tools
2. **Adaptive Ranking**: Uses weighted metrics to rank tools
3. **Workflow Selection**: Picks the most appropriate workflow based on environment
4. **Polymorphic Adaptation**: Implements code-mutation techniques for resilience

### Implementation

The framework is implemented in Python with the following key functions:

- `rank_tools()`: Ranks tools based on weighted metrics using linear algebra
- `fetch_github_tools()`: Fetches top GitHub tools based on stars and other metrics
- `pick_workflow_type()`: Selects workflow type based on environment variables
- `fetch_tool_recommendations_perplexity()`: Fetches tool recommendations using Perplexity API

## 3. GitHub Workflow Integration

The framework integrates with GitHub Actions through a workflow file (`.github/workflows/poly-ci.yml`) that:

1. Runs on push to main branch or weekly schedule
2. Discovers and ranks automation tools
3. Selects and deploys appropriate workflows
4. Self-heals by automatically adapting to changes

## 4. Key Features

- **Pluggable**: Extendable for additional tool APIs (ZenHub, Codespaces, n8n, BugBug)
- **Polymorphic/Adaptive**: Auto-tunes scoring strategy and dynamically regenerates workflow configs
- **Self-healing**: Reruns automatically; always pulls, ranks, and prepares top tools and workflows latest from the open-source ecosystem
- **Linux-native**: Works out-of-the-box with `apt`/`pip`; containers/Docker supported
- **Composable and modular**: Plug new discovery sources, ranking backends, shell/Python mutators
- **Secret/audit-ready**: Protect credentials, enable RBAC and full change tracking for regulatory contexts

## 5. Installation and Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_poly.txt
   ```

2. Set up GitHub token as environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   ```

3. Run the framework:
   ```bash
   python poly_framework.py
   ```

## 6. Extensibility

The framework can be extended to:

- Integrate with additional tool APIs
- Implement different ranking algorithms
- Add support for more workflow types
- Incorporate machine learning for adaptive optimization
- Add polymorphic code mutation techniques

## 7. Research Validation

The framework is validated by:

- **Shannon entropy**: Track diversity/adaptability of tool and workflow choices
- **Convergence rate**: How many cycles to reach stable, high-quality builds
- **DORA/DevOps**: Mean time to restore (MTTR), deployment frequency, change success rate, failure rate
- **A/B Testing**: Scheduled alternation of workflow policies; compare output for statistical improvement
- **Perplexity**: Score clarity and correctness of explanations/code produced by AI models in the pipeline
