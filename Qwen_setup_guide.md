# Qwen Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Qwen for your AI/ML projects.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

## Installation Steps

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv qwen-env
   source qwen-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: qwen-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers pandas scikit-learn numpy
   ```

3. For additional functionality, you might want to install:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Using Qwen for Code Generation

1. Prepare a clear prompt describing what you want to build
2. Include specific requirements like:
   - Programming language
   - Libraries to use
   - Input/output formats
   - Performance requirements

Example prompt:
"Write a Python script using Hugging Face Transformers to fine-tune a BERT model for sentiment analysis on a CSV dataset with columns 'text' and 'label'."

## Best Practices

1. Always review and test the generated code before using it in production
2. Provide detailed prompts for better results
3. Iterate on the prompts based on the quality of the output
4. Combine Qwen's output with your domain expertise for optimal results

## Example Workflow

1. Define the problem clearly
2. Create a prompt for Qwen with specific requirements
3. Review and modify the generated code as needed
4. Test the implementation
5. Document the solution
6. Push to GitHub with a clear README
