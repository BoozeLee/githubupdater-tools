## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### [Sentiment Analysis with BERT](https://github.com/BoozeLee/sentiment-analysis-bert)
A fine-tuned BERT model for sentiment classification using Hugging Face Transformers. This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Implement state-of-the-art NLP models
- Fine-tune transformer architectures
- Preprocess and tokenize text data
- Train and evaluate machine learning models

### [Qwen Polymorphic Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/BoozeLee/qwen-polymorphic-sentiment-analysis)
Advanced sentiment analysis using Codestral with polymorphic research integration. This project incorporates recent breakthroughs in polymorphic malware detection techniques and machine learning methodologies to create a robust sentiment classifier.

### [Computer Vision Classification](https://github.com/BoozeLee/cv-classification-project)
A CNN-based image classification system that achieves high accuracy on custom datasets.

### [Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/BoozeLee/time-series-forecasting)
An LSTM-based solution for multivariate time series forecasting with real-time predictions.

### [Poly-AI Framework](https://github.com/BoozeLee/githubupdater-tools)
A deployable polymorphic Linux/AI framework for adaptive GitHub workflow automation. This framework leverages live tool discovery, adaptive scoring, and plug-and-play workflow generation to create self-adaptive, AI-enhanced GitHub workflows.

## ðŸ§  Poly-AI Framework

This repository also includes a deployable polymorphic Linux/AI framework for adaptive GitHub workflow automation. The framework features:

- **Live Tool Discovery**: Automatically finds and ranks the best GitHub automation tools
- **Adaptive Scoring**: Uses linear algebra and weighted metrics to rank tools
- **Plug-and-Play Workflows**: Dynamically generates workflow configurations
- **Polymorphic Code Practice**: Implements code-mutation techniques for resilience

### Key Components

1. **Poly Framework Engine** (`poly_framework.py`): Core engine that discovers, ranks, and selects tools
2. **GitHub Workflow** (`.github/workflows/poly-ci.yml`): Automated workflow that runs the poly framework
3. **Requirements** (`requirements_poly.txt`): Dependencies for the poly framework

### How It Works

The framework uses mathematical foundations including linear algebra, graph theory, and probability to:
- Discover top GitHub automation tools
- Rank them based on stars, forks, and topic tags
- Select the most appropriate workflow based on environment variables
- Continuously adapt to changes in the open-source ecosystem

## ðŸ’¼ AI Job Framework

The repository also contains a comprehensive AI job framework that helps identify and apply for high-paying AI/ML opportunities:

- **Live Job Scraping**: Finds current AI job opportunities across multiple platforms
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Prioritizes jobs with immediate payment and high-value skills
- **Automated Applications**: Generates customized proposals for top opportunities
- **Qwen Integration**: Leverages the latest Qwen models for AI development projects

### Key Components

1. **Job Finder Scripts** (`script.py`, `script2.py`, `script3.py`): Multiple implementations of the job finding framework
2. **Documentation** (`ai-job-framework.md`, `qwen-enhanced-framework.md`): Comprehensive guides for using the framework
3. **Data Exports** (`ai_jobs_live_results.csv`, `ai_job_applications_ready.csv`): Exported job data and applications
