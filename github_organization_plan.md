# GitHub Repository Organization Plan

## Current Repositories
1. Baker-Street-Laboratory
2. MIT License
3. dyad
4. GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0
5. githubupdater-tools
6. sentiment-analysis-bert
7. voidshatterecho
8. symmetrical-waffle (newly created)

## Repository Cleanup and Organization

### 1. Repository Renaming
- Rename "MIT License" to a more descriptive name
- Rename "GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0" to a more descriptive name

### 2. Repository Categorization
#### AI/ML Projects
- sentiment-analysis-bert (keep as is)
- symmetrical-waffle (Qwen Polymorphic Sentiment Analysis - rename to "qwen-polymorphic-sentiment-analysis")

#### Tools and Utilities
- githubupdater-tools (keep as is)

#### Other Projects
- Baker-Street-Laboratory
- dyad
- voidshatterecho

### 3. License Standardization
For all repositories, ensure they have appropriate licenses:
- AI/ML research projects: Research and Educational Software License
- Tools and utilities: MIT License
- Other projects: Appropriate license based on purpose

### 4. README Enhancement
Each repository should have a comprehensive README with:
- Project description
- Setup instructions
- Usage examples
- License information
- Contact information

### 5. Repository Cleanup
- Remove repositories that are empty or contain only license files
- Merge similar projects where appropriate
- Archive old projects that are no longer maintained

### 6. Repository Management
- Use the `manage_repos.sh` script to maintain consistency across all repositories
- Regularly review repository status and update as needed
- Ensure all repositories follow the bakerstreet concept of organization and documentation

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions
1. Rename "symmetrical-waffle" to "qwen-polymorphic-sentiment-analysis"
2. Update README files in all repositories
3. Add proper licenses to all repositories
4. Remove repositories that contain only license text

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)
1. Enhance documentation in all repositories
2. Add proper tags and descriptions
3. Create a main profile README showcasing your best projects
4. Set up automated weekly updates for active projects

### Long-term Goals (1-2 months)
1. Archive old/unmaintained projects
2. Create a portfolio website linking to your GitHub projects
3. Add CI/CD pipelines to active repositories
4. Write blog posts about your projects and link them in READMEs

## Repository Descriptions

### qwen-polymorphic-sentiment-analysis (symmetrical-waffle)
Advanced sentiment analysis using Qwen2.5-Coder with polymorphic research integration. This project leverages the latest Qwen2.5-Coder-7B model to create an advanced sentiment analysis classifier that incorporates recent breakthroughs in polymorphic malware detection techniques and machine learning methodologies.

### sentiment-analysis-bert
A fine-tuned BERT model for sentiment classification using Hugging Face Transformers. This project demonstrates ability to implement state-of-the-art NLP models, fine-tune transformer architectures, preprocess and tokenize text data, and train and evaluate machine learning models.

### githubupdater-tools
Tools for managing and updating GitHub profile and projects. Contains automation scripts for regular GitHub updates, project tracking, and profile management.

## License Recommendations

### Research Projects
Research and Educational Software License - Restricts usage to non-commercial research and educational purposes while protecting intellectual property.

### Tools and Utilities
MIT License - Permissive open-source license that allows broad usage while providing liability protection.

### General Purpose Projects
Appropriate license based on project goals (GPL for copyleft, Apache for patent protection, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. Rename repositories with descriptive names
2. Add proper README files to all repositories
3. Standardize licenses across all repositories
4. Create a main profile README showcasing your skills and projects
5. Set up automation for regular updates
